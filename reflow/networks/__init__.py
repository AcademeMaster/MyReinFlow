Neural Network Architectures

This module contains various neural network architectures used in the flow models:
- MLP: Multi-layer perceptrons with different variants
- FlowMLP: Specialized MLP for flow velocity prediction
- Transformer: Transformer-based architectures
- Vision Transformer: ViT implementations
- Embedding: Position and time embeddings
